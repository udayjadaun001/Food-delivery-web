# Food-delivery-web
This is a simple web application for managing food orders without needing a massive enterprise setup. It’s a clean web app built with just the basics: HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript logic.

#What it actually does:

Quick Entry: You can toss new orders into the system using the built-in form.

The Big Picture: A simple table view to see every order currently in the queue.

Easy Filtering: I added some logic to sort through things quickly—you can filter by who has paid (or hasn't) and how far the delivery distance is.

#Features:
- Simple, clean design
- Easy to use form for adding new orders
- Filterable table view to quickly see orders by payment status and delivery distance
- Responsive design for easy use on mobile devices

#Tech Stack:
